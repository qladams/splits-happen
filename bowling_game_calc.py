# Python script that calculates and returns the total score of a game of
# bowling.
#
# Rules:
# To briefly summarize the scoring for this form of bowling:
#  - One game of bowling is made up of ten frames.
#  - In each frame, the bowler has two throws to knock down all the pins.
#  - Possible results for a frame:
#  -- Strike ('X'): the bowler knocks down all 10 pins on the first throw. The
#     frame is over early. The score for the frame is 10 plus the total pins
#     knocked down on the next two throws.
#  -- Spare ('/'): the bowler knocks down all 10 pins using two throws. The
#     score for the frame is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down on the
#     next throw.
#  -- Open frame: the bowler knocks down less than 10 pins with his two throws.
#     The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down.
#  - The game score is the total of all frame scores.
#  - Special rules for the 10th frame:
#  -- A strike in the tenth frame gives the bowler two bonus throws, to fill
#     out the scoring formula for the last frame.
#  -- A spare in the tenth frame gives the bowler one bonus throw, to fill out
#     the scoring formula for the last frame.
#  -- These throws count as part of the 10th frame.
#  -- The process does not repeat - for example, knocking down all 10 pins on a
#     bonus throw does not provide any additional bonus throws.
#
# Following cases are outside the scope of the current exercise:
# - Check for valid throws (like scores that add to 11)
# - Check for the correct number of throws and frames
# - Provide any intermediate scores - it only has to provide the final score
